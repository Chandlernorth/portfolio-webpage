                        Hello! I'm Chandler North, a passionate UX/UI designer dedicated to crafting meaningful and user-centered experiences. With a keen eye for detail, I strive to create intuitive and visually appealing interfaces that enhance the way people interact with digital products. I use Figma, Adobe Xd and other tools to help streamline the design process. My approach to design is to find the intersection between aesthetics and functionality.
